## Usage
The project connects to the localhost to access a mysql database. There is a schema file that shows how to set up the "employees_db" database, as well as a seed file for testing the application. Following the CRUD model, the user can add, view, update and delete either employees, roles, or departments of a company. The user also has the ability to see employees of a certain department or role as well as see the whole budget of a specific department.
